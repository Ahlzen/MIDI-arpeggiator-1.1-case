# MIDI-arpeggiator-1.1-case
Case and panel artwork for MIDI Arpeggiator v1.1

## Case parts

These parts are created with OpenSCAD (source included) and are designed to be 3D-printed.

Adjust parameters in *common.scad* to adjust size, positions, case thickness, rounding, etc.

* *case-bottom.scad* and *case-top.scad* are meant to be printed face down.
* *button.scad* creates a complete set of panel buttons connected by thin flexible strings (so they stay aligned)
* *knob.scad* TODO.

## Assembly

Top and bottom are fasened with a small self-tapping screw. Wood/plastic thread or machine thread will probably all work - just adjust
the hole diameter in *common.scad* to adjust for your printer and screw. Rule of thumb is to make the hole size about the same diameter
as the major diameter of the screw (outside of the thread) - then the pull/shrinkage during print
